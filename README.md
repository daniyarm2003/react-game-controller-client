# Game Controller Web Client

This React web application serves as a user friendly way to send commands to a variety of different games to externally control them. The currently implemented games are [Minecraft](https://github.com/daniyarm2003/tcp-controller-mod-2), GTA V, and Terraria. For each game, there must be a mod installed that accepts commands sent from clients such as this web application. Each mod processes the commands to perform actions such as adding items, setting velocity, and other game specific actions. See the Minecraft mod example [here](https://github.com/daniyarm2003/tcp-controller-mod-2).
